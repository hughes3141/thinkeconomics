<h1>Black Wednesday Summary Questions</h1>
<p>Black Wednesday (16 September 1992) is easily the most interesting and relevant story that illustrates the principles of fixed exchange rate systems.</p>
<p>If you can explain what happened to the British Government on this day, you will have a very good handle on exchange rates.</p>
<p>These questions are to compliment the 1997 BBC1 Documentary: <em>Black Wednesday. </em>This video is 49 minutes long and available here: <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/K_oET45GzMI">Black Wednesday Video</a></p>
