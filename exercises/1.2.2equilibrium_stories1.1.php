<h2 id="q01">Britain&rsquo;s Cocaine Glut</h2>
<p>7 December 2017</p>
<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2017/12/07/britains-cocaine-glut" target="_blank">https://www.economist.com/britain/2017/12/07/britains-cocaine-glut</a></p>

<p>Cocaine in London in 2017 is much cheaper than it was five years ago. Dealers know that their product is no longer scarce, and many are resorting to discounts (e.g. &ldquo;Black Friday discounts&rdquo;) to boost sales.</p>
<p>The quantity of the drug consumed seems to be rising by most estimates. Between 2010 and 2016 the number amount of cocaine seized by the authorities doubled to 5.5 tonnes. Analysis of sewage in London shows that there is double the amount of substances which the human body produces after consuming the drug. The number of crack cocaine users rose by about 10% between 2011 and 2015.</p>
<p>Street prices have not changed, though wholesale prices have fallen by 15% between 2014 and 2016. (Street prices do not change because users already know the standard price per gram).</p>
<p>Why has this been happening? Colombia, a main producer of the drug, has increased its production of coca from 49,000 hectare in 2012 to 146,000 in 2016. The Colombian government also stopped spraying weed killer on coca fields from airplanes. Also, as part of the recent peace deal in Colombia farmers were given money to switch away from coca- but the farmers knew this beforehand, so they grew more coca before the deal was signed to get more money for switching.</p>
<p>Another factor is that demand in America is falling, due to users getting older and tougher crackdowns on trafficking from Mexico.</p>
<p>The cheaper cocaine has a human price- the number of deaths related to cocaine or crack in England and Wales jumped from 139 in 2012 to 371 in 2016.</p>

<img src="files/londonfalling.jpg" style="float:right" width="500" height="500" alt="London House Prices">
<p>Since 1990 the price of an average house in London has tripled in real terms. But the market may be turning. The priciest 5-10% of homes have seen prices fall 15% below their peak in 2015. In some districts such as Mayfair and St James&rsquo;s homes used to sell for more than &pound;50m, but in 2017 the maximum was approximately &pound;30m. Part of this is because of uncertainty surrounding Brexit. The government also put up stamp duty (tax) on houses worth more than &pound;1m.</p>
<p>Houses in other price ranges have seen prices have been growing more slowly lately. Some blame an increase in supply: the building rate of new house in London has risen, and the projection for the number of new houses completed in 2017 was 46,500, above the target of 42,000.</p>
<p>New regulations on mortgages have also played their part. Banks can no longer lend so much to first-time buyers, which has meant that some people can no longer purchase a house.</p>

<h2 id="q03" style="clear:both">The perilous politics of parking</h2>
<p>6 April 2017</p>
<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/04/06/the-perilous-politics-of-parking" target="_blank">https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/04/06/the-perilous-politics-of-parking</a></p>
<p><a href="files/The Perilous Politics of Parking.pdf" target="_blank">Article PDF</a></p>
<p>Think of parking as an economic good- it is supplied, either by the government or through private individuals who are forced to create parking when they build new buildings, and it is demanded by drivers, who sometimes often have to pay for it. Space given to parking lots certainly has an opportunity cost- just think of the other parks or buildings that could be used on the land instead.</p>
<p>In many places people can park on the street for nothing, or for very little. In Boston, MA, most meters charge $1.25 per hour. Because drivers spend so long looking for these great deals, many end up circling the block. In the German city of Freiburg one study found that 75% of all cars on the road were simply looking for a place to park.</p>
<p>In order to increase parking spaces, many cities require developers to build new parking whenever they build a new building. In St Paul, MN, there must be four spaces for every hole on a golf course. The new Apple HQ in California has 318,000 square metres for office and laboratories; the city of Cupertino has a law that required them to build 325,000 square metres of cark parks.</p>
<p>Cities should stop trying to increase the supply of parking and instead should raise the prices until the streets and car parks are nearly, but not quite, full. This would help speed the transport revolution that will come about from self-driving cars.</p>
<ol>
<li>The supply curve for parking will be vertical. Explain whether you agree with this view.</li>
<button id="b6" onclick ="answer(6)">Click for Answer</button>
</ol>
<div class="ans a03" id="a6">
<p>In the short term it could be argued that the supply curve for parking is vertical because there is only a certain amount of parking available at any given time.</p>
<p>In the long term, however, one might argue that the supply of parking would increase with price. Higher priced parking spaces might convince people to convert buildings into parking garages or turn vacant lots into car parks.</p>

<p>There is evidence in the article to suggest that at $1.25 per hour, there is excess demand. There are too many drivers looking for too few spaces, and they end up circling the block.</p>
<p>The diagram shows the effect of this: a price which is too low, and too many people looking for spaces.</p>
<p>If the market were allowed to reach equilibrium, then the price would be higher.</p>

<li>Evaluate whether car parking should be more expensive in cities.</li>
<button id="b9" onclick ="answer(9)">Click for Answer</button>
</ol>
<div class="ans a03" id="a9">

<p>This article gives a strong perspective that parking should be more expensive in cities. The suggestion is that too much parking is built on land which has opportunity cost. In other words, the land that is currently used for parking spaces could be better used doing something else.</p>
<p>The counter-argument would be that free parking facilitates driving into cities at lower cost, enabling workers to travel and helping economic growth.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the article is that parking should certainly be more expensive in cities. This would use the price mechanism to signal to consumers (drivers) that they should ration their use of parking, encouraging them to use other modes of transportation (such as public transit) that would produce fewer negative externalities.</p>

<p>A surrogate mother carries and gives birth to a baby for another person or couple. The baby is usually comes from embryos that are created in vitro with eggs and sperm from the commissioning parents or donors.</p>
<p>Many countries ban surrogacy. Many countries ban payments made to women who would like to act as a surrogate mother.</p>
<p>Demand for surrogate mothers has risen in recent years. Part of this is due to the spread of gay marriage and male couples using surrogate mothers to complete their families.</p>
<p>Women who become surrogates generally take great satisfaction in helping people become parents. Some argue that providing this service should be paid, as it would allow more surrogate mothers to be available for the new rising demand.</p>
<ol>

<p>If payment were allowed to be made to surrogate mothers, this would mean that price could be above zero. The higher price would extend the supply curve as more women entered the market to be paid to act as a surrogate. The high price would contract the demand.

<p>Twenty years ago students could go to university for free; the government paid the cost. This meant that many institutions struggled financially, and there were strict limits on the numbers of students universities were allowed to take. Since then universities have been allowed to raise fees, gradually up to &pound;9,000 in 2012. This has meant that higher education now extends to 40% of 18-year-olds, up from 30%.</p>
<p>Loans for university students are generous: graduates only start to pay once they make over &pound;21,000 per year, and after 30 years the loan is written off. The argument against going back to a system without student fees is that wealthy students, who could have paid anyway, will benefit from general taxation while poorer students will not be able to access courses because universities will not be willing to offer them.</p>

<p>The hottest property investment in the UK is where you may least expect it- arable farmland. Over the past decade farmland prices have grown at twice the rate of prime London property prices. Farmland in the UK is 3 time as much as in America, and 15 time as much as farmland in Australia.</p>
<p>One reason is that people just aren&rsquo;t selling it. In 2000 300,000 acres were on the market, but last year it was below 150,000, or less than 0.5% of Britain&rsquo;s farmland. Another reason is that climate change is affecting food supply abroad, which makes British farmland more attractive. Tax breaks on owning farmland help because farmland is exempt from inheritance tax after seven years as long as the farmer farms it.</p>
<p>Foreign investors and pension funds are attracted to farmland because it is seen as a good investment, particularly in a recession. Farmers are growing richer as well, due to rising prices in their crops (wheat was 80% more expensive in 2014 than it was in 2009) and are buying more farmland from golf-course developers. Farmers themselves in 2014 made up 66% of buyers, up from 40% in 2004.</p>
<p>This trend is set to continue, as the supply of farmland shrinks every year. The only thing that makes it look like this growth will slow could be that prices of crops may fall soon. This will be due to the increased number of producers of these crops, which would push down their price.</p>

<p><a href="files/The French are Fretting Over a Butter Shortage.pdf" target="_blank">Article PDF</a></p>
<p>There was a catastrophe in Paris in 2017: butter prices soared. Bakers have been able to keep their production of croissants (which use lots of butter), but they are making lower profit margins because the cost of butter is so high.</p>
<p>In some places, such as local supermarkets, there are butter shortages. Some consumers are hoarding what they can find. Butter is essential for much French cuisine, and the French eat more of it than anybody else.</p>
<p>Some part of this explanation is that demand is growing from other parts of the world. &ldquo;China has discovered croissants,&rdquo; says Emmanuelle Auriole of the Toulouse School of Economics. Others in western countries are buying more full-cream milk, cheese, and butter as they become more informed of the dangers of alternatives such as sugar.</p>
<p>A global dairy-price index is up by 27% in a year. However, suppliers have responded slowly to the rise in price because recent reforms made it harder for them to plan production.</p>
<p>One solution would be for French cooks to look to alternatives instead of butter. One reporter asked a baker whether she might try to bake with margarine. &ldquo;We use butter or nothing,&rdquo; the baker responded, wagging a finger. Clearly this would be unacceptable.</p>
