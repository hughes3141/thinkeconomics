<h1>Shop, then drop:&nbsp;Britain&rsquo;s consumer boom shows signs of petering out</h1>
<h2>The spending spree that has kept the economy going since Brexit may be nearing its end</h2>

<p>FOR the past seven months the British economy has defied the predictions of analysts, most of whom expected a recession to follow the Brexit referendum in June. GDP grew by 2% in 2016, faster than in any other G7 country&mdash;and the economy did better in the second half than in the first. The unexpectedly strong performance is largely thanks to the efforts of households, which have been spending liberally. In the fourth quarter of 2016 the volume of retail sales, excluding petrol, was 6% higher than in the year before, the biggest rise since 2004. Nor is the weak pound preventing families from splurging on foreign holidays (see&nbsp;<a  target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21716041-sterling-may-be-down-foreign-trips-are-up-british-tourists-have-not-let-weak-pound-spoil">article</a>). But there are signs that Britons&rsquo; freewheeling ways may not last much longer.</p>
<p>The fortunes of the economy rise and fall with households&rsquo; spending habits. In the years after the financial crisis of 2008-09, belts were tightened as people lost their jobs and real wages fell. But retail spending picked up from 2014. This was thanks to falling unemployment and faster earnings growth. In 2011-13 real disposable household income shrank on average by 2% a year but in 2014-16 it grew by 3% a year. The median (after taxes and benefits) now stands at &pound;26,300 ($33,300).</p>
<p>With this in mind it is not surprising that consumer spending remained strong after the Brexit vote. The result itself may even have spurred consumption. Half of voters plumped for Leave, after all, so they may be happier shoppers than before. Those who are gloomier about Britain&rsquo;s prospects seem to have brought their consumption forward, loading up on foreign goods before the weak pound causes prices to rise. The value of sales of drinks and tobacco, much of which are imported, jumped by 25% year on year in December.</p>
<p>But in recent months Britons&rsquo; desire for new iPads and sofas has outpaced their ability to pay for them. After the referendum, households continued to indulge in unsecured borrowing, thanks in part to the Bank of England&rsquo;s looser monetary policy. People now appear to have decided that with Brexit negotiations about to get under way and the attendant economic uncertainty, they should focus less on borrowing and more on repaying. On January 31st the Bank of England revealed that consumer-credit growth in December fell to &pound;1bn from &pound;1.9bn the month before.</p>
<p>Rising prices will also cramp consumer spending. Inflation may near 3% by the end of the year. Food staples are getting dearer: those who gave up Marmite on their breakfast toast after it became more expensive last year will soon have nowhere to hide, after Weetabix warned this week that it too was considering a price rise. As the cost of everyday essentials goes up, households will have less money left over for other things, making them feel poorer. Credit Suisse, a bank, reckons that consumer-spending growth will drop from 2.8% last year to 0.7% in 2017.</p>
<p>This is worrying because until now consumers&rsquo; willingness to spend has helped to prop up an otherwise poorly supported economy. The government is tightening austerity this year, sucking away demand. Investment is weak by historical standards and is likely to slip further as firms hold off on plans to expand their operations in Brexit-bound Britain. Bank lending to non-financial firms fell by 1% in the fourth quarter. And despite the sharp drop in the value of sterling since June, exports are hardly booming. If the consumer-spending spree comes to an end too, it is hard to see where economic growth will come from.</p>

<h2>Questions:</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>What is a &lsquo;recession&rsquo;?</p> <button class="toggleAnswer">Click to show answer</button>
<p class="answer">A recession is two consecutive quarters (6 months) of negative economic growth.</p></li>
<li><p>What does GDP measure?</p><button class="toggleAnswer">Click to show answer</button>
<p class="answer">GDP measures economic output in the economy. It is a proxy for income (GDP = Output = Income = Expenditure)</p></li>

<li><p>Why would you expect British families to cut back on foreign holidays due to a weak pound?</p><button class="toggleAnswer">Click to show answer</button>
<p class="answer">A weak pound would make foreign holidays more expensive. For example: if the pound were weak, say &pound;1 = $1.25, then a hotel room in the USA costing $200 per night would cost &pound;160 (200 &divide; 1.25 = 160). If the pound were strong, say &pound;1 = $2, then the same hotel room would cost &pound;100 (200 &divide; 2 = 100). Thus weak pound makes foreign holidays more affordable for British families, suggesting that British families would <em>import</em> more of these foreign experiences.</p></li>

<li><p>Explain, using information in paragraph 2, how unemployment and real disposable income affect consumption.</p><button class="toggleAnswer">Click to show answer</button>
<p class="answer">Higher unemployment will lead to lower consumption because unemployed people have limited income and therefore do not spend as much on consumer goods. Real disposable income growth will allow people to consume more, as is evidenced in the article: retail spending picked up from 2014, at the same time when real disposable income started growing (by 3% a year in 2014-2016, compared to a fall in 2% pear year from 2011-2013).</p></li>

<li><p>Explain the two reasons why consumption may have risen following the Brexit vote, according to paragraph 3.</p><button class="toggleAnswer">Click to show answer</button>
<p class="answer">A majority (over 50%) of people voted for Brexit, so the result made them happy and willing to spend more money. People who were uncertain about the future would have also brought their consumption forward, afraid that prices might go up soon.</p></li>

<li><p>What kind of interest rate does &lsquo;looser monetary policy&rsquo; imply? How will interest rates affect consumption?</p><button class="toggleAnswer">Click to show answer</button>
<p class="answer">&lsquo;Looser monetary policy&rsquo; means that the Bank of England has lowered interest rates. Lower interest rates would encourage consumer spending, because (a) it is cheaper to borrow money that can be used for consumption and (b) those on variable-rate mortgages pay less in mortgage payments each month, and therefore have more money for consumer goods.</p></li>

<li><p>What is the relationship between consumer spending and inflation, according to paragraph 5? Which of the three reasons of AD sloping downwards does this relate to?</p><button class="toggleAnswer">Click to show answer</button>
<p class="answer">As inflation increases, consumer spending will decrease. This refers to the <strong>real balance effect</strong>: given a certain <em>nominal income</em>, inflation will mean that <em>real incomes</em> are lower and consumers cannot afford to buy as much.</p></li>

<li><p>What has government spending been like during this time? What effect will this have on AD?</p><button class="toggleAnswer">Click to show answer</button>
<p class="answer">Government spending has been weak. Government policy was one of <strong>austerity</strong>, meaning that government budgets were lowered to bring down overall spending levels. According to the article, this will &lsquo;suck away demand.&rsquo;</p></li>

<li><p>What has Investment been like during this time? Why has this been the case (the article mentions two reasons why businesses are not investing)?</p><button class="toggleAnswer">Click to show answer</button>
<p class="answer">Investment is weak, not to its usual level. This is because (a) firms, uncertain over future Brexit arrangements, are holding off on their plans to expand and (b) banks are not lending as much to businesses.</p></li>

<li><p>What has been happening to Net Exports? How does this relate to the exchange rate? Is this what we would expect?</p><button class="toggleAnswer">Click to show answer</button>
<p class="answer">Net exports are &lsquo;hardly booming.&rsquo; The exchange rate is weak (&lsquo; . . . sharp drop in the value of sterling since June . . .&rsquo;), which would suggest that net exports should be expanding. We would expect the opposite; a lower exchange rate should mean that net exports increase. (This is a good example of how unresponsive net exports are to changes in exchange rates)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Extension Questions:</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><p>How do households&rsquo; ability to borrow affect their consumption levels?</p><button class="toggleAnswer">Click to show answer</button>
<p class="answer">A household&rsquo;s ability to borrow will tend to increase their consumer spending. Access to in-store finance schemes or credit cards make it easier for consumers to spend money that they do not yet have, which will lead to higher consumption levels.</p></li>
