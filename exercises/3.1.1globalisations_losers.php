<p><strong>Short summary</strong>: This article explores the reasons for why globalisation has increased regional inequality in places like the USA, and the policies that can be done to help correct this.</p>
<p><strong>Longer summary: </strong>(P = paragraph no.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Political parties that are anti-globalisation are on the rise, despite their policies being harmful to their supporters. (P1-2)</li>
<li>Globalisation means that some cities get incredibly rich (e.g. San Francisco, London) while others become very poor (e.g. Blackpool, Detroit). Economies of scale mean that globalised firms cluster in &lsquo;superstar places.&rsquo; (P3-4)</li>
<li>Despite the wider income between places, people are less likely to move. Big cities are too expensive (because not enough houses are built). Dual-income families depend on two jobs and are less mobile. People are now looking after their parents and can&rsquo;t move away from them. Welfare payments make people less likely to move from struggling places. (P5-6)</li>
<li>The way to solve this problem is to:
<ul>
<li>Build more houses in thriving places</li>
<li>Remove occupational licensing for workers.</li>
<li>Subsidies places that have been left behind.</li>
<li>Improve competition policy to allow jobs to be created outside of big cities.</li>
<li>Improve the provision of local colleges and training centres.</li>
<li>Encourage big firms (e.g. Amazon) to build headquarters in other cities besides the big ones. (P7-9)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Glossary:</h2>
<p><strong>Populism: </strong>Political movement that encourages a focus on the people within their own country. Example: Donald Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Occupational Licensing: </strong>Industry-specific licensing rules that allow professionals to work.<strong> State-specific</strong> occupational licensing refers to different US states having different</p>
<p><strong>Industrial concentration</strong> refers to the number of firms in an industry; more concentrated = fewer firms.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamism</strong> refers to how innovative and creative your economy is (more innovative = more dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Assuaging </strong>= to make (an unpleasant feeling) less intense</p>
<h2>Quick Questions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>What types of policies are those which are described in paragraphs 7-9?</li>
<li>Evaluate the best policies to ensure that those worst affected by globalisation are not left behind.</li>
<li>To what extent would these policies be appropriate in the context of Cornwall? Has Cornwall been &lsquo;left behind&rsquo;? Use evidence.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Extended Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Economic theory suggests that regional inequalities should diminish as poorer (and cheaper) places attract investment and grow faster than richer ones.&rdquo; Explain why this will lead to poor places (like Detroit) being less poor and rich places (like San Francisco) being less rich.</li>
<li>Economies of scale refer to advantages that large firms (and large cities) have over smaller ones. Explain why having more users will make a social network more attractive to new users.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Soaring housing costs in prosperous cities keeps newcomers out.&rdquo; Explain what type of supply-side policy could be used to help get workers to move more often.</li>
<li>&ldquo;In America the spread of state-specific occupational licensing and government benefits punishes those who move.&rdquo; Explain why this will punish those who move and suggest a supply-side policy that would help get workers moving more. (Key word: <strong>occupational licensing</strong> refers to government-mandated qualifications that an individual must have to work in a particular industry, e.g. qualification to be a teacher/dentist/doctor. In the USA you may need to have a different qualification when moving between different states.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Unemployment and heal benefits enable the least employable people to survive in struggling places when once they would have had no choice but to move.&rdquo; Explain a supply-side policy that could help this problem.</li>
<li>&ldquo;South Carolina lured BMW to the state in 1992 and form it built a thriving automotive cluster.&rdquo; Explain what supply-side policy is being described here, and why it doesn&rsquo;t always work.</li>
<li>&ldquo;A beefed-up competition policy could reduce industrial concentration, which saps the economy from dynamism while focusing the gains from growth in fewer firms and places.&rdquo; Key words: <strong>industrial concentration</strong> refers to the number of firms in an industry (&lsquo;reducing industrial concentration&rsquo; = encouraging more firms to start up). <strong>Dynamism</strong> refers to how innovative and creative your economy is (more innovative = more dynamic). Why would these be considered to be supply-side policies?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Bolder still would be to expand the mission of local colleges.&rdquo; Explain, with an example, why this is an effective supply-side policy. Use any example you want (there are loads in the paragraph!).</li>
<li>&ldquo;Assuaging the anger of the left-behind means realising that places matter, too.&rdquo; <strong>Assuaging </strong>= to make (an unpleasant feeling) less intense. What is the main message of this article?</li>
