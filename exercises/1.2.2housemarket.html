<div id ="14">
<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>This is a role-playing game in which you are going to imagine that you are buying or selling a house.</p>

<ol>
<li>Your character will either be a buyer or a seller.</li>
<li>Do not tell <strong>ANYBODY</strong> about the price that you are willing to sell the house for or pay for a new one. This is private information.</li>
<li>If the price is right, you <strong>MUST</strong> sell/buy for the price that is dictated on the card.</li>
<li>All houses are the same, and there is no point of holding out for something better.</li>
<li>In the first two rounds, the prices will be given by an external source. Act on this information.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="13" style="display:none;">
<h1>Round 2</h1>
<p>You are going back to the market.</p>
<p>This time assume a new identity. Your teacher will assign you a new number.</p>
<p>Sell or buy a house. Talk with the other people there, get a feel for the market.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p><strong>Do not tell people how much you would be willing to buy or sell your house.</strong></p>

<h1>Round 1</h1>
<p>Meet with the other buyers and sellers. Get a feel of who is willing to buy and sell.</p>
<p><strong>Do not tell people how much you would be willing to buy or sell your house.</strong></p>
<p>When the time is right, your teacher will tell you the price that the estate agents think houses in the road will go for.</p>

<h1>Prices Revealed!!!</h1>
<p>Once you learn of the selling price, you can decide what you want to do. Are you going to buy a house? Are you going to sell one?</p>
<p>Once people make up their mind, you want to make a deal. Get the best house that you can! (And don&rsquo;t be shy)</p>
<ol>
<li>How many houses were bought and sold?</li>
<li>How did you decide who got to buy/sell?</li>
<li>Who was happy? Who was not?</li>
<li>What does this suggest about the price?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>Who is happy, who is frustrated?</p>
<p>How long were the houses on the market?</p>
<p>Did they get snatched up, or did they linger?</p>
<p>Was it a buyer&rsquo;s or seller&rsquo;s market?</p>
<p>Were the houses allocated fairly?</p>

<h1>Final Task: Pair up</h1>
<p>You are no longer going to rely on estate agents to set the price. You are now allowed to bargain for any price that you like.</p>
<p>Pair up between buyers and sellers using the following rules:</p>
<h2>Sellers:</h2>
<p>If somebody approaches you and makes you an offer for more than you were willing to sell the house, sell the house.</p>
<p><strong>However: if anybody else comes along and offers you a higher price, take that deal.</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t settle your pair until you are sure you&rsquo;ve got the best price.</p>
<h2>Buyers:</h2>
<p>If you find a house that a seller is willing to sell at a lower price than you are willing to buy, then buy the house!</p>
<p><strong>However: if you find another house for a lower price, take that deal (these houses are all the same)</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t settle your pair until you are sure you&rsquo;ve got the best price.</p>
