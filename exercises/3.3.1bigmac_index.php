  <div class="  mx-auto p-4 mt-2 bg-white text-black mb-5">


    <p class="mb-3">Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a concept in economics that states that exchange rates between two countries should be a point where the price of a basket of goods, once adjusted for the exchange rate, is identical between the two countries.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">The Purchasing Power Parity exchange rate is the exchange rate that makes a basket of goods the same price between two countries. In this exercise we will investigate whether this is the case, or whether countries have currencies which are overvalued or undervalued against each other.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">To illustrate this concept we will use the Big Mac Index from <em>The Economist</em>. This index was set up as a bit of a joke, but it has since become a bit serious. <em>The Economist</em> tracks the price of Big Macs (a good sold around the world) along with the exchange rate for different currencies. You can find an explanation (and the data) here: <a class="underline text-sky-700" href="https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index">https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index</a>.</p>
    <p class="mb-3"><u>Task</u>: Select some countries that you think would be interesting. Look at the figures. See if you can work out whether the country&rsquo;s currency is overvalued or undervalued against the pound.</p>
